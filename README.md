### 💾 Hi there!


My name is Diana Martins and I have found a new joy in life, coding!

  One day, whilst thinking of creating my own pastry brand, I realized that I needed a website. So in order to make my own website, I went down the rabbit hole of coding! I then went into the Northcoders Software Developer bootcamp to learn more about becoming a full stack developer! 

  It has been an amazing experience and I have certainly enjoyed the challenge it presented!

  Then at the end of June 2023, I started working as a Junior Developer at Wren Kitchens, where I've been working with Php, Symfony, along with Tailwind, Svelte, Javascript and Typecript. Been improving my knowledge of Postman and Docker as well.


### 🧵 Fun facts:

  - 🍰 Pastry Chef: I previously worked as a Pastry Chef and I enjoy baking yummy treats and breads on my spare time!
  - 🪴 Plant person: I love gardening and enjoy the challenge of starting plants from seed and seeing them grow and thrive.
